## Installation & development

You'll need npm, bower, and gulp (`npm install -g gulp; npm install -g bower`). Also, you need compass (see .travis.yml for an example of how to fulfil the compass and sass dependencies).

`npm install`

`gulp build`

`gulp watch` to recompile on change

`gulp deploy` to copy files to our live container (you need access, obviously!)
