        For the past few months, we have been collecting information about grants made in Detroit. We <a href=”archive of mailing list posts, first post?”>started this project</a> with a desire to explore the data and see what turns up. Here’s what we’ve learned.

      <p>We ended up with a hair shy of 2,000 grants from hundreds of organizations. You can <strong><a href="http://data.detroitledger.org">browse all the data here</a></strong> &mdash; or read on for an overview.</p>

      <h2 class="callout">How we got here</h2>
      <p>Much of the data is scoured from “forms 990” - tax filings for 501(c) tax exempt organizations. This leaves out some of the smaller organizations as well as the immense number of nonprofits that don’t have tax exempt status, like public charter schools.
      There are more foundations that fly under the radar -- we started tackling some of them, like <link the outliers here></p>

      <h2 class="callout">So many grants!</h2>
      <p>We've organized 1,942 grants from 2009-2013. The records range from <a href="http://data.detroitledger.org/node/22787">a $42 token of support given to a university department</a> to <a href="http://data.detroitledger.org/node/23244">$47 million of federal HUD funding</a>.</p>

      <p>To give a sense of the general scale of grant amounts, the graph below shows the distribution of all grants (we've left out the gigantic HUD grants because they distort the scale):</p>

      <h2 class="callout">Insight</h2>
      <p>To get an idea of the potential research and insight one can glean from the detail in our dataset, let's look at micro-funding. <a href="http://data.detroitledger.org/content/detroit-soup">Detroit Soup</a> is one of a few examples of granting organizations that deliver small (100-1,000 dollar) grants. This sector is off the radar of larger grant databases. Look how SOUP's grant giving has grown since its humble beginnings:</p>
      <div class="d3" data-type="org_grants" data-options-id="21620"></div>
      <p>By continuing to collect data about small-scale grant givers, we hope to shed light on this growing sector.</p>

      <h2 class="callout">Most connected funders</h2>

      <p>In the network of philanthropy, the most connected funders are foundations that reach out to the most unique recipients.  These are often the funders who also have the highest number of individual grants each year, not necessarily the most money granted though.  The least connected funders are the foundations that funnel their funds to a small set of organizations, often the same ones year to year.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Skillman Foundation</li>
        <li>DTE Energy Foundation</li>
        <li>Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan</li>
        <li>Kresge Foundation</li>
        <li>Kellogg Foundation</li>

  <section class="wrap contrast">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="callout">Most connected recipients</h2>
      <p> The most connected recipients are organizations that receive grants from the most unique funders.  These aren't necessarily organizations that receive the most money annually, but are organizations that receive support from a variety of different foundations.  Least connected recipients are organizations that have received a single grant from a single source.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Detroit Symphony Orchestra</li>
        <li>Wayne State University</li>
        <li>Sphinx Organization, Inc</li>

      <h2 class="callout">How we did it &mdash; and some caveats</h2>
      <p>Much of the data is scoured from “forms 990” - tax filings for 501(c) tax exempt organizations. This leaves out some of the smaller organizations as well as the immense number of nonprofits that don’t have tax exempt status, like public charter schools.</p>

      <p>There are more foundations that fly under the radar -- we started tackling some of them, like <link the outliers here></p>

      <p>Grant money is often pipelined through multiple organizations…
      Some non-profits have very tight relationships with other organizations that might not have open books.</p>
